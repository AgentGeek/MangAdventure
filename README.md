MangAdventure, aka MangADV, is a simple manga hosting webapp.

It is fully written in Django, SCSS and Vanilla JS. No PHP, no Bootstrap, no jQuery.

* Search for series.
* More features coming.

## Documentation

The documentation is available on [Read the Docs](https://mangadventure.rtfd.io).

## Configuration

You can configure the site via the admin panel
If you want to overwrite the styling of the site,
you can write some SCSS (or regular CSS) in the
`static/extra/styles.scss` file.

## Development

To debug the server set the environment variable `MANGADV_DEBUG`
to `true`. **Don't do this in production.**

You shouldn't use the production server during development.
You can use Django's `runserver` command to run a development
server on `127.0.0.1:8000` (or any other address you specify).
